# Pandas_Data_Cleaning_Project
This project focuses on using Pandas, a powerful Python library, to clean and prepare a dataset for analysis. The dataset contains employee information such as names, domains, designations, experience, skills, and salaries. Some entries have missing or inconsistent data, which we aim to fix using Pandas techniques.
